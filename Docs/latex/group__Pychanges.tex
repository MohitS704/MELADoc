\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
These are additions to the M\+E\+LA code that allow for the Python to operate. 

The changes made provide for a more usable/readable version of the Python bindings. They do not change any of the functionality of M\+E\+LA, but simply provide either compatibility fixes or syntactic sugar.
