The Simple\+Particle\+\_\+t for Python is a type definition defined as T\+Var\+::\+Simple\+Particle\+\_\+t. These are defined as pairs of an integer and a 4-\/vector, and are the primary input object used for every particle.

Due to difficulties with interfacing between R\+O\+OT\textquotesingle{}s py\+R\+O\+OT implemenetation of \href{https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLorentzVector.html}{\texttt{ T\+Lorentz\+Vector}}, there are new functions that operate as constructors.\hypertarget{pyDocs_Constructors}{}\doxysubsection{Constructors}\label{pyDocs_Constructors}
There are 3 constructors for the Simple\+Particle in Python\+: \hypertarget{pyDocs_collection_initializer_from_column}{}\doxysubsubsection{collection\+\_\+initializer\+\_\+from\+\_\+column}\label{pyDocs_collection_initializer_from_column}
{\ttfamily collection\+\_\+initializer\+\_\+from\+\_\+column} takes in the list of particles as a column.
