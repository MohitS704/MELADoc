\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./setup.sh -\/j N \# (N being the number of cores to compile, or blank for max. allowed)}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The script decides whether to use integration with the experiments\textquotesingle{} software.
\item Either the one in this folder, or that in the main J\+H\+U\+Gen\+M\+E\+LA folder works; they do the same thing.
\item Feedback on how this script works in different environments is appreciated.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{eval \$(./setup.sh env) \# or equivalents in non-\/bash shells}
\end{DoxyCode}
