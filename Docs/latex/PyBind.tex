There exists a Python implementation of M\+E\+LA functions created via Py\+Bind11. These functions are documented in \mbox{\hyperlink{mela__binding_8cpp}{mela\+\_\+binding.\+cpp}}. There are three groups of functions that are implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Functions that are implemented as pass-\/by-\/reference in C++ that need to be converted to functions that return a value
\item Functions that don\textquotesingle{}t translate well between Python and C++ that need to be rewritten in a more compatible format
\item Functions that just need to be referenced within the Py\+Bind framework without any extra overhead
\end{DoxyItemize}

The first two categories are detailed in the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Pychanges}{Novel Python Functions}} section.
